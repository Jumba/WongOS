memory allocation in the form of a linked list.

memory is allocated in form of:

 -- prev_memory : memory : next_memory
 
 If there is no prev_memory fill as 0x0001
 if there's no next_memory fill as 0xFFFF
 
Memory is allocated in blocks of 16 words.

word 0 : prev_memory (default 0x0001)
word 16: next_memory (default 0xFFFF)


To remove an allocation simple set the next_memory of the prev_memory to the next_memory of the link to be removed. Furthermore set prev_memory of the next_memory to the prev_memory of the removed link. 


First memory location is the first multiple of 0x000f after the location of os_end

Fragmentation:

Each link of 16 words has an internal fragmentation of 2 words, used for the prev_memory and next_memory pointers.

Thus for a malloc of size 15 two links are needed, with a fragmentation of 13 words.
